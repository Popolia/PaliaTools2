 The following images come from a person who used it other than me to show you what happens :
 this will delete the game and the register

I had it tested on a French person other than myself to explain the process to you, but in English it's the same procedure. The images are there just to show you more or less the process, because an image is worth a thousand words. 

ps: the images are a little dated, as everything is now translated into English on the .bat site

Why am I getting this message?

to answer your question about a .bat file, most computers report .bat files downloaded from the internet as extremely dangerous and prevent you from running them. This is why it is often preferable to create your own file".
I'll give you the .bat because  file, it's quicker, but there's nothing to stop you reading it if you have any doubts. After all, it's normal in today's world.

How do I view the file?

in Github just left-click sur Del_registre_singularity 6.bat
